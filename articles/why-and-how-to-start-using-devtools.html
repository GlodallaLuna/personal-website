            <p class="text-small">Sep 23, 2022</p>
            <div class="text section__text">
                <p class="text__paragraph">If I could give a piece of advice to my former self back when I started
                    learning web development,
                    it would be to <strong>start using Devtools from day one</strong>. </p>
                <p class="text__paragraph">
                    In my personal experience, while the first CSS courses I followed online taught me a lot about CSS
                    theory and encouraged me
                    to learn through practice, <strong>they didn’t put enough emphasis on the importance of developer
                        tools.</strong>
                    In JavaScript, on the other hand,
                    every lesson starts by showing you the console, as it’s crucial to understanding how the language
                    works. </p>
                <p class="text__paragraph">
                    I believe that a good understanding of what happens <strong>behind the scenes</strong> on a webpage
                    is not only useful for<strong> debugging</strong>,
                    but is also a fundamental step in your journey <strong>to really understand CSS</strong>.</p>

                <p class="text__paragraph">I should start by saying that I really like CSS, but that wasn’t exactly the
                    feeling I had when I started and
                    I’ve noticed that the same is true for a lot of developers. </p>
                <p class="text__paragraph">
                    This seems to be especially true for people who know other programming languages,
                    who often get frustrated by the fact that CSS works very differently to other languages.</p>
                <p class="text__paragraph">
                    My opinion completely changed once I had a better understanding of CSS. I realized that it is
                    actually fun and Devtools were a game changer for me.</p>

                <!--section intro-->
                <h2 class="article__title--section">Accessing the DevTools Window</h2>
                <p class="text__paragraph">Every major browser has Devtools. I personally use the ones in both Chrome
                    and Firefox, because they have different,
                    interesting features.</p>
                <p class="text__paragraph">To open up your Devtools, you just need to press <code>F12</code> or
                    <code>Command+Option+C</code> (Mac), <code>Control+Shift+C</code> (Windows, Linux).
                    Alternatively, you can right click and choose inspect element. </p>

                <!--section features-->
                <h2 class="article__title--section">Features:</h2>
                <p class="text__paragraph">Let’s talk first about my favourite feature:</p>
                <!--Select Element Tool-->
                <h2 class="article__title--section">The Select Element Tool</h2>
                <p class="text__paragraph">For beginners, the select element tool will quickly become your best friend.
                    This can be accessed by clicking the icon
                    as shown in the picture.</p>
                <img class="article__img" src="images/select-element-tool.svg"
                    alt="accessing the select element tool, the element panel and the styles panel">
                <img class="article__img" src="images/selecting-element-in-the-webpage 1.svg"
                    alt="selecting element in the webpage">
                <p class="text__paragraph">Now you can highlight elements on your webpage to understand how much space
                    they take (padding, border and margin) and
                    even change properties and values and see the results in real-time. You’ll finally find out what is
                    causing that annoying white space!</p>
                <p class="text__paragraph">Whenever you select an element on the webpage, it will also be highlighted in
                     the elements panel and will show all the properties being applied in the styles tab.</p>

                <!--Box Model-->     
                <h2 class="article__title--section">The Box Model visual representation</h2>
                <p class="text__paragraph">Something I find myself doing very often is experimenting with the visual 
                    representation of the box model. </p>  
                <div class="article-container__img">
                    <img class="article__img" src="images/visual-box-model.svg"
                    alt="visual representation of the Box Model">
                </div>
                <p class="text__paragraph">This tool is located in the computed tab on Chrome while you’ll find it in the Layout 
                    tab if you are on Firefox.</p>
                <p class="text__paragraph">It allows you to change the values of padding and margin directly in the browser to see
                     how they look and, once you are satisfied, you can edit them in the HTML and CSS source code.</p>
                
                <!--Flexbox and grid editor tool-->     
                <h2 class="article__title--section">Flexbox and grid editor tool</h2> 
                <div class="article-container__img">
                    <img class="article__img" src="images/Flexbox-and-grid-editor-tool.svg"
                    alt="Flexbox and grid editor tool">
                </div>   
                <p class="text__paragraph">Chances are you are using both flexbox and grid in your design. 
                    If so, Google Chrome has provided a very cool tool to help edit and debug them.</p> 

                <p class="text__paragraph">You just need to click on the icon next to the display property and a panel 
                    will pop up. Then you’ll be able to play around with all the flex or grid properties.</p> 
                <p class="text__paragraph">I remember when I started using flexbox I always got confused with the align and justify properties.
                     With this tool you just need to click on the icons below the property name, which also offer a visual representation of 
                     the default behavior, and see what happens in your website without messing with your source code.</p> 
                
                <p class="text__paragraph">Another important feature is:</p> 
                <!--the Responsive Mode-->     
                <h2 class="article__title--section">The Responsive Mode</h2>
                <div class="article-container__img">
                    <img class="article__img article__img--vertical" src="images/responsive-mode.svg"
                    alt="Flexbox and grid editor tool">
                </div> 
                <p class="text__paragraph">Making a responsive website is never easy and can be especially intimidating for a beginner.</p>
                <p class="text__paragraph">This special mode makes our life easier by showing our website on a list of different devices. 
                    It also allows us to manually resize the window by dragging the corner on the screen to any size we want.</p>  
                <p class="text__paragraph">This way it becomes easier to decide where to include breakpoints and all the things we need to modify
                     on our webpage to make it look good at all sizes. </p>  
                     
                <!--conclusions-->     
                <h2 class="article__title--section">Conclusions</h2>
                <p class="text__paragraph">Obviously there are many more advanced features and a lot more you can do with the developer tools.
                     These are just the ones that have massively helped me have a better understanding of CSS and that I recommend to everyone who is learning it. 
                    I also hope they will make you appreciate CSS a bit more.</p>
